If after clicking run we get this error message 


"
Could not determine GDB version using command: arm-none-eabi-gdb --version
arm-none-eabi-gdb: error while loading shared libraries: libtinfo.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
"


Then Do :


sudo apt update
sudo apt install libtinfo5


If i get error like after giving above command

"
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

"
That error means something went wrong during a package install using apt, often because of:

    A broken or partially installed package

    File conflicts

    Dependency issues

Then Do:

Step 1:

sudo apt --fix-broken install
sudo apt install libtinfo5

Step 2:

sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt clean
sudo apt update

Step 3:

sudo apt install libtinfo5



If i again get "E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)"

Then : 

"trying to overwrite shared '/usr/share/doc/libtinfo5/changelog.Debian.gz', which is different from other instances of package libtinfo5:amd64"

This means the system thinks multiple versions or instances of libtinfo5 exist, and theyâ€™re conflicting on a shared file.

command:

sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/libtinfo5_6.3-2ubuntu0.1_amd64.deb

sudo apt --fix-broken install





Now run the code
